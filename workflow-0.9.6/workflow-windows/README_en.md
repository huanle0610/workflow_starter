# Sogou C++ Workflow
#### As the backend C++ programming standard in Sogou, Workflow is an industrial-grade programming engine. 
#### Main functions and features:
  * An **asynchronous engine** based on **C++11** ``std::function`` which aims to solve all the **serial, parallel and asynchronous** problems.
  * As a network framework, it is completely **protocol-agnostic** and directly facing applications.
    * It can either be used as a Redis **client** or an Http **server**.
    * Convinient to **customize protocols**, so you can quickly build your own RPC systems.
      * Sogou RPC is developed based on Sogou Workflow and is open source as an independent project. The project supports srpc, brpc and thrift protocols ([benchmark](https://github.com/holmes1412/sogou-rpc-benchmark)).
    * Support **SSL** (depends on openssl). Support **TCP, UDP, SCTP** and other common transport layer protocols. Support SSL on **SCTP**. Not support UDP server.
  * A variety of **common Internet protocol** implementations are natively integrated and used in a unified way.
    * Currently support **http, redis, mysql** and **kafka** protocols. You can directly access these resources or build **servers** for these protocols.
    * Highly likely the only C++ full-featured **mysql asynchronous client** on the market.
    * **DNS** protocol is being developing and currently we use the system library to access DNS.
  * Powerful feature for **scheduling computing tasks**
    * Computing task, as well as communication task, can be added into the task flow and they’re scheduled separately by their corresponding scheduler.
    * You can use it as a parallel programming engine **without** the network features.
    * Our biggest goal is to **maximize the performance** of every node when the calculation and communication environment is very complex.
    * Some **common algorithm** implementations are provided, such as parallel sorting and MapReduce.
    * In fact, all asynchronous processes (such as disk IO, GPU tasks, timers, etc.) **can be scheduled in coordination**.
      * On the Linux system, the disk IO task is realized through the Linux underlying aio, which is extremely efficient.
  * Support any task flow with **DAG** structure. However, in most cases, users only need **series-parallel** structure.
  * Built-in **load balancing** and powerful **service governance** features.
  * Easily used in conjunction with other asynchronous engines.
  * **Streaming** communication engine is being developed.
  * When working as a server, it supports **multi-processes** mode and precisely supports **graceful restart**.

#### Building
  * Support **Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Windows** and other systems so far. Installing **cmake** is necessary.
    * Windows version is temporarily released as an independent branch, which uses **iocp** as the basis for asynchronous communication and mean while, keeping the **same external interface**.
  * As written in C/C++, it requires the users being able to proficiently use C++ programing. It **does not** rely on boost or asio, therefor the compiling speed is extremely fast.
  * It contains a small numbers of C++11 features, so users need to being able to use ``std::function`` and ``std::move``.
  * Theoretically support all CPU architectures and can be compiled and run on **32-bit** or **64-bit arm processors**. Big endian CPU is not tested.
  * **openssl** is required. If users expect high performance of SSL, openssl 1.1 or higher is strongly recommended.
  * **No other dependencies**. Several compression libraries such as snappy and lz4  is contained by their unmodified source (required by the Kafka protocol).

#### Some features of design
  * The basic usage is very simple and handy. Some features are designed to greatly reduce the difficulty of programming with general C++ projects.
    * To **avoid** users to **derive** as much as possible, all user behaviors are wrapped with std::function, for example:
      * the **callback** after every task ends
      * the **algorithms** in computing tasks
      * one server corresponds to one ``std::function``
    * Trying to avoid complicated memory management, all tasks and frameworks are generated by **factory** classes, and their memory is **recycled automatically**. Which means,
      * Every task is **automatically deleted after its callback**.
      * If the users want to keep any data in the task (such as a network reply packet or the result of an algorithm), they need to use ``std::move`` to move it.
      * We treat memory recycle as a strict and naturally logical mechanism, so we **don’t** use share_ptr.
    * Avoid using complicated parameter configuration.
      * Actually we have a lot of **configurable parameters**, though you can use our system **without** feeling the parameters exist.
      * If you have specific requirements for program behavior and resource ratio, you can definitely find the corresponding parameter configuration items in order to maximize the performance of you program.
  * The project adopts a fully asynchronous design and is not transparent to users, which means users need to know that they are writing asynchronous programs.
    * Thanks to the convenience brought by ``std::function`` and the automatic memory recycling mechanism, we have delicately designed **the simply possible usage of asynchrony** for users.
    * **No** user-mode threads concepts. On the one hand, performance is considered. On the other hand, we have the concept of computing tasks (threaded tasks) scheduling.
      * In our design, **computing** is one kind of **asynchronous task**, which has no differences from communication.
      * Computing tasks are scheduled by **independent thread groups** according to specific algorithms, please note that they **may not** be executed **immediately**.
      * As we have such computing tasks, user-mode threads become meaningless, and therefore users must understand asynchrony.
    * Because of the full asynchrony, almost all core calls are **short** and **non-blocking** operations.
      * That’s why we **don’t** recommend users to **block** their programs in callback or do some complex calculations. However, it acceptable if the logic is quite simple.
   * Brief summary of the usage:
    * The user builds the program just like building a **series-parallel** circuit. The circuit can be generated **at the beginning** or **dynamically during the program running**.
    * **We provide various electronic components** for users. For instance, one http request, one GPU matrix multiplication, and one parallel sorting can all be understood as a electronic component.
    * Every electronic component has its **standard input and output**. At the meantime, every electronic component can be a **complicated circuit**, which has no necessary to be perceived by the users.
    * For example, an http request may go through **multiple asynchronous processes** such as DNS, redirect, and retry, but the entire processes is just a **component** in the perspective of the users.
    * Users can easily **define their own** components, including algorithms and some kind of communication.
      * To implement **stateless protocols** is extremely simple. It may be a little bit complicated when the protocol includes login, library selection, etc., at this time, you can refer to the redis implementation.
    * Through the powerful Upstream system, complex **service governance** can be realized, such as communication node selection, load balancing, circuit breaker and recovery, main and backup, etc.
    * **In conclusion, this is an enterprise-level, elegantly designed asynchronous framework which can cover almost all high-performance back-end service requirements.**
