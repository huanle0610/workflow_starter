Tips

1, comment the install part in windows cmake file otherwise configure failed

2, it will automatically find crypto and ssl lib in system, if not exist you must prebuild and install

3, change one line code to pass the compile in vs2019

Communicator.cc:207

int CommMessageIn::feedback(const void *buf, size_t size)

to 

int CommMessageIn::feedback(const char *buf, size_t size)

4, workflow will generate _include dir for header path when built, maybe no need to use this dir

5, do not use generated _lib dir, just link to every single component static lib

6, use standalone openssl include and source code to compile the ssl and crypto lib as dependency

7, just compile the workflow source to project, the original cmake file too complex
